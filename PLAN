1. Planning Phase
Goals: Define what you want to accomplish.

Track income, expenses, and balance.
Categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, entertainment).
View history and possibly analytics (spending trends, category breakdown).
Features to Implement:

User registration and login system.
Transaction management (add, view, edit, delete).
Categorization of transactions (tags/labels).
Simple balance tracking.
Basic summary and analysis (e.g., total income, expenses, remaining balance).
Database Schema:

Users: Store user details (username, email, password).
Transactions: Store transaction details (amount, date, category, user_id).
Categories: Store categories for transactions (e.g., food, rent, entertainment).
Tech Stack:

Java for backend.
SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
JDBC for database interaction.
(Optional) Front-end/UI: Could be console-based or a simple GUI using JavaFX or Swing.

2. Core Features Development

Phase 1: User Management (1–2 days)

User Registration & Login:
Create the User class.
Implement user creation (store hashed passwords) and login functionality.
Implement session management (login status tracking).
Phase 2: Database Interaction (2–3 days)

Set Up Database Schema:
Implement SQL scripts to create tables (Users, Transactions, Categories).
Database Connection & Manager:
Create a DatabaseManager class for managing the connection.
Basic CRUD Operations:
Implement methods for basic interactions (insert, update, delete, and fetch records for Users and Transactions).
3. Transaction Management (4–5 days)

Phase 1: Transaction CRUD (2–3 days)

Add Transactions:
Implement adding transactions (amount, date, category).
View Transactions:
Display list of transactions for the logged-in user.
Update/Delete Transactions:
Implement functionality to modify or remove transactions.
Phase 2: Categorization (1–2 days)

Add Categories:
Allow users to define categories for their transactions.
Assign Category to Transaction:
Make sure each transaction can be linked to a category.
4. Core UI Development (5–7 days)

Phase 1: Basic UI (Optional)

Console-based or JavaFX/Swing GUI:
Design user-friendly interface (list of transactions, add form, categories dropdown).
Display current balance and transaction history.
Phase 2: User Interaction (Optional)

Allow users to interact with the app:
Add, view, edit, and remove transactions.
Display summary (e.g., balance, total expenses, total income).
5. Analytics & Summary (3–4 days)

Balance Calculation:
Calculate and display current balance (income – expenses).
Monthly Summary:
Show total income, total expenses, and category-wise breakdown.
Visualizations (Optional):
Basic charts for spending trends (pie charts for categories, bar charts for spending over time).
6. Testing & Debugging (3–4 days)

Unit Testing:
Write tests for your main classes (User, Transaction, DatabaseManager).
Ensure all methods work as expected (e.g., adding a transaction updates the balance).
Debugging:
Fix issues that arise during testing.
Test edge cases like negative transactions or invalid inputs.
7. Finalizing & Deployment (2–3 days)

Documentation:
Document your codebase (especially methods and class functions).
Deploy/Package:
Package the application into an executable JAR or deploy it on a local server.
Presentation/Report:
Prepare a presentation or report for your professor, highlighting key features and challenges you faced.
8. Stretch Goals (Optional)

Recurring Transactions:
Allow users to set recurring expenses (e.g., subscriptions).
Export Data:
Enable exporting data (e.g., CSV or PDF report).
Advanced Analytics:
More complex visualizations (e.g., spending trends, forecasted balance).
